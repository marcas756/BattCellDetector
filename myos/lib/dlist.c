    \brief      Circular doubly linked list

    \details    In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements,
                whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
                Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting
                of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form,
                each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node
                in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements
                from any position in the sequence during iteration.
                [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list]

                In a 'doubly linked list', each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field
                pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. The two links may be called 'forward('s') and
                'backwards', or 'next' and 'prev'('previous').
                [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Doubly_linked_list]

                In the last node of a list, the link field often contains a null reference, a
                special value is used to indicate the lack of further nodes. A less common convention
                is to make it point to the first node of the list; in that case, the list is said to
                be 'circular' or 'circularly linked'; otherwise, it is said to be 'open' or 'linear'.
                It is a list where the last pointer points to the first node.
