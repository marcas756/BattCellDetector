 *
 * @brief Provides preprocessor macros for bit manipulations and bit testing.
 *
 * @details
 * Bit Field:
 *          A bit field is an unsigned integer where single bits or groups of bits are
 *          combined. It represents a compound data type at the bit level, unlike
 *          primitive data types where the entire value is interpreted collectively.
 *          Bit fields are embedded within the data type of the binary number, differing
 *          from bit arrays which are more explicit structures.
 *          More information can be found at [Wikipedia - Bit field](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfeld).
 *
 * Bit Mask:
 *          A bit mask is used to isolate or manipulate subsets of bits within a bit field.
 *          While hardware often supports direct access to individual bits, compiler-level
 *          support typically involves using a bit mask in conjunction with boolean bit
 *          operations like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. Bit masks are specially crafted bit fields
 *          that don't hold data themselves but facilitate operations on other bit fields.
 *          For further reading, visit [Wikipedia - Bit array](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitkette).
 *
 *          These macros provide a convenient and efficient way to perform common bit
 *          manipulations. They are useful in various scenarios, such as setting, clearing,
 *          toggling, and testing the state of flags or configuration options represented as bits.
 *
 *          Bit manipulation is crucial in low-level programming, hardware interfacing, and
 *          situations where performance and memory optimization are essential. These operations
 *          offer fine-grained control over data at the bit level, allowing for compact
 *          representation and efficient manipulation of state and configuration data.
 *
 * Usage:
 *          Include this header file in your project to utilize the provided bit manipulation
 *          and testing macros. These macros are generic and work with any standard C integer types.
 *
 * @note Refer to each macro's documentation for specific usage examples.
 *
 * @see BITS, BITS_INVERT, BITS_TEST, BITS_SET, BITS_CLEAR, BITS_TOGGLE
 *
 * This file was documented in doxygen style format by using ChatGPT 4.

/**
 * @brief Reads out specific bits from a bit field using a bit mask.
 * @details This macro allows for extracting specific bits from a bit field by performing
 *          a logical AND operation with a bit mask. The bit mask should have bits set
 *          (1s) at the positions you want to read and cleared (0s) elsewhere. When the
 *          bit field is AND-ed with this mask, the resulting value contains the bits
 *          from the original bit field that align with the 1s in the mask, with all
 *          other bits set to 0.
 *
 *          This operation is commonly used to isolate a subset of bits within a larger
 *          bit field for examination or further processing.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *      1-Bit:
 *          01001011 (bit field)
 *      AND 00001000 (bit mask)
 *      ------------
 *          00001000 (result - Bit extracted)
 *
 *      0-Bit:
 *          01001011 (bit field)
 *      AND 00000100 (bit mask)
 *      ------------
 *          00000000 (result - Bit not present)
 *
 * @param x The bit field from which to extract bits.
 * @param m The bit mask specifying which bits to extract.
 * @return The result of the bit field AND-ed with the bit mask.
 */
#define BITS(x,m)           ((x)&(m))

/**
 * @brief Toggles all bits of an integer.
 * @details This macro inverts all bits of the given integer. Each bit that is 0
 *          becomes 1, and each bit that is 1 becomes 0. This is achieved using the
 *          bitwise NOT operation. The inversion of bits is a common operation in
 *          scenarios where you need to flip the bit pattern, for example, when
 *          implementing bitwise algorithms or performing certain kinds of data
 *          transformations.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *      Original:
 *          01001011 (Original bit pattern of integer)
 *      Invert:
 *          ~01001011
 *      ------------
 *          10110100 (Inverted bit pattern)
 *
 * @param x The integer whose bits are to be toggled.
 * @return The result of inverting all bits of the given integer.
 */
#define BITS_INVERT(x)      (~x)

/**
 * @brief Tests if all bits defined by a bit mask are set in the bit field.
 * @details This macro checks whether all the bits specified in the bit mask are set
 *          (i.e., are 1) in the given bit field. It first performs a logical AND
 *          operation between the bit field and the bit mask, then compares the result
 *          to the bit mask. If the comparison is equal, it means all the bits in the
 *          bit field corresponding to the set bits in the mask are also set.
 *
 *          This operation is useful for checking the state of multiple bits at once
 *          in a bit field, such as in flag checking or feature enabling scenarios.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *      Check if specific bits are set:
 *          Bit field: 01101101
 *          Bit mask:  00001101
 *      Test:
 *          (01101101 & 00001101) == 00001101
 *      ------------
 *          Result is true (all specified bits are set)
 *
 * @param x The bit field to test.
 * @param m The bit mask defining which bits to check.
 * @return True if all bits defined by the bit mask are set in the bit field, false otherwise.
 */
#define BITS_TEST(x,m)      (((x)&(m))==(m)))

/**
 * @brief Sets specified bits to logical 1 in a bit field.
 * @details This macro sets one or more specific bits of a bit field to 1 by logically
 *          OR-ing the bit field with a bit mask. The bit mask should have bits set
 *          (1s) at the positions you want to set and cleared (0s) elsewhere. When the
 *          bit field is OR-ed with this mask, the specified bits in the bit field
 *          are set to 1, while the rest remain unchanged.
 *
 *          This operation is commonly used for setting flags or enabling features
 *          represented by specific bits in a larger bit field.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *      Set specific bits to 1:
 *          Bit field: 01001011
 *          Bit mask:  00000100
 *      Set:
 *          01001011 | 00000100
 *      ------------
 *          01001111 (Result with specified bits set to 1)
 *
 * @param x The bit field in which to set bits.
 * @param m The bit mask defining which bits to set to 1.
 */
#define BITS_SET(x,m)       ((x)|=(m))

/**
 * @brief Sets specified bits to logical 0 in a bit field.
 * @details This macro clears (sets to 0) one or more specific bits of a bit field by
 *          logically AND-ing the bit field with the inverted bit mask. The bit mask
 *          should have bits set (1s) at the positions you want to clear and cleared (0s)
 *          elsewhere. When the inverted mask is AND-ed with the bit field, the specified
 *          bits in the bit field are set to 0, while the rest remain unchanged.
 *
 *          This operation is typically used for clearing flags or disabling features
 *          represented by specific bits within a larger bit field.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *      Clear specific bits to 0:
 *          Bit field: 01001011
 *          Bit mask:  00001000
 *      Clear:
 *          01001011 & ~00001000
 *      ------------
 *          01000011 (Result with specified bits cleared to 0)
 *
 * @param x The bit field in which to clear bits.
 * @param m The bit mask defining which bits to set to 0.
 */
#define BITS_CLEAR(x,m)     ((x)&=~(m))

/**
 * @brief Toggles specified bits in a bit field.
 * @details This macro toggles (flips) one or more specific bits of a bit field by logically
 *          XOR-ing the bit field with a bit mask. The bit mask should have bits set (1s) at
 *          the positions you want to toggle and cleared (0s) elsewhere. When the bit field is
 *          XOR-ed with this mask, the specified bits in the bit field are flipped, i.e., 0
 *          becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0, while the rest of the bits remain unchanged.
 *
 *          This operation is useful for changing the state of flags or toggling features
 *          on and off within a bit field.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *      Toggle specific bits:
 *          Bit field: 01001011
 *          Bit mask:  00000110
 *      Toggle:
 *          01001011 XOR 00000110
 *      ------------
 *          01001101 (Result with specified bits toggled)
 *
 * @param x The bit field in which to toggle bits.
 * @param m The bit mask defining which bits to flip.
