 * @brief Process management and event scheduler for MyOs.
 *
 * @details
 * This file defines the API for managing processes and scheduling events in MyOs.
 * The implementation extends the concepts from the Contiki operating system,
 * adapting them to the specific needs and architecture of MyOs.
 *
 * Processes in MyOs are lightweight, protothread-based tasks that can be
 * scheduled to run concurrently. The process scheduler handles the execution
 * of these processes and the dispatching of events to them.
 *
 * Key features and differences from Contiki:
 * - Uses MyOs-specific data structures like ring buffers and (singly or doubly)
 *   linked lists for managing processes and events.
 * - Enhanced configurability, allowing the use of different list types for
 *   process management.
 * - Integration with MyOs's protothread implementation and local continuation
 *   concepts.
 * - A flexible event system that supports both synchronous and asynchronous
 *   event posting, suitable for various application scenarios, including
 *   interrupt handling.
 * - Detailed statistics collection for monitoring and debugging, depending
 *   on compile-time configuration (MYOSCONF_STATS).
 *
 * Event System and Process Polling:
 * - MyOs employs an event system where processes can communicate and signal
 *   each other through events.
 * - Processes can post events either synchronously or asynchronously. Asynchronous
 *   events are queued and processed in the main loop context.
 * - The process polling mechanism is primarily triggered from Interrupt Service
 *   Routines (ISR) and is executed in the main loop context, allowing processes
 *   to handle interrupt-driven events in a safe manner.
 *
 * @note This implementation diverges from Contiki by removing certain legacy
 *       constructs and focusing on a more modular and clean design, tailored to
 *       the specific requirements of MyOs.

 * @file
 * @brief Configuration for the type of list used for the running process list in myos.
 *
 * @details
 * This section of the code allows for the configuration of the type of list used to manage
 * the running processes in the operating system. The type of list can be specified in the
 * myos configuration file. By default, a singly linked list is used.
 *
 * The configuration can be modified to use a doubly linked list by defining the
 * MYOSCONF_DLIST macro in the configuration file. If MYOSCONF_DLIST is defined, the
 * corresponding doubly linked list implementation will be used; otherwise, the default
 * singly linked list implementation (slist) is utilized.
 *
 * The list type affects how processes are stored, accessed, and manipulated during
 * execution. The choice between a singly or doubly linked list can have implications
 * for performance and memory usage, depending on the specific needs and constraints of
 * the system.
 *
 * Singly Linked List Implementation:
 * - A singly linked list (slist) is used when MYOSCONF_DLIST is not defined.
 * - The singly linked list provides a simple and memory-efficient way to manage the
 *   running processes with basic operations like initialization, addition, deletion,
 *   and iteration over the list.
 *
 * Example of configuring a singly linked list for process management:
 * \code{.c}
 * #define MYOSCONF_PROC_LIST_TYPE MYOSCONF_SLIST
 * \endcode
 *
 * @note Currently, only the singly linked list implementation is supported. The
 *       implementation for the doubly linked list (dlist) is planned for future
 *       development.

 * @def PROCESS_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE
 * @brief Defines the size of the process event queue.
 *
 * @details
 * This macro sets the size of the event queue used by the process scheduler. The size determines
 * how many events can be queued at one time before the system starts dropping or ignoring new events.
 *
 * If the macro `MYOSCONF_PROC_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE` is defined in the myos configuration file, its value
 * is used to set the size of the event queue. If it is not defined, a default size of 8 is used.
 *
 * Adjusting the event queue size can have implications on the system's performance and memory usage.
 * A larger queue size can handle more events but requires more memory, whereas a smaller queue size
 * conserves memory but may lead to dropped events in high-load scenarios.
 *
 * Example of configuring a custom event queue size:
 * \code{.c}
 * // In the myos configuration file
 * #define MYOSCONF_PROC_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE 16
 * \endcode
 *
 * @note The configuration of the event queue size should be carefully considered based on the expected
 *       workload and available system resources.

 *
 * @details
 * This function runs the process scheduler of the operating system. It handles
 * all pending poll requests and then delivers events from the event queue to
 * the corresponding processes.
 *
 * Poll requests are typically triggered by interrupts and are processed first.
 * Each process that has a pending poll request will be handled, and the
 * poll request flag will be reset. After handling all poll requests, the
 * function processes the next event in the event queue, if any.
 *
 * The function returns the count of remaining events in the queue plus any
 * outstanding global poll requests. This can be used to determine if there
 * are more events to process or if the system can go to a low-power mode,
 * for example.
 *
 * @note
 * If `MYOSCONF_STATS` is defined, the function measures the processing time
 * and updates the maximum processing time statistic.
 *
 * If `MYOSCONF_PTIMERS` is defined, the function also handles the processing
 * of protothread timers.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * while(1) {
 *   process_run();
 *   // Additional operations such as entering low-power mode.
 * }
 * @endcode

/**
 * @brief Requests a poll for a specific process.
 *
 * @param process Pointer to the process to be polled.
 *
 * @details
 * This function is used to request a poll for a specific process. When called,
 * it sets the `pollreq` flag of the specified process to true, indicating that
 * the process should be polled. Additionally, it sets a global flag
 * `process_global_pollreq` to true, indicating that at least one process needs
 * to be polled.
 *
 * The actual polling is performed in the `process_run` function, where all
 * processes with the `pollreq` flag set will be processed.
 *
 * @note
 * This function is typically used by interrupt service routines or other parts
 * of the system that need to trigger a process to run outside of its normal
 * scheduling.
 *
 * Debugging messages are printed with information about the process polling
 * request if the DEBUG_PROCESS macro is defined.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * process_poll(&my_process);
 * @endcode
