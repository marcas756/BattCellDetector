 * @brief Abstract Base Class for Process Timers in MyOS.
 *
 * @details ptimer in MyOS serves as an abstract base class for specialized timers like etimers (event timers) and ctimers (callback timers),
 *          providing foundational functionalities for these derived classes. As MyOS is a cooperative and non-preemptive operating system,
 *          ptimers are dependent on the OS's scheduling and cannot be used for bare-metal programming. They enable scheduled tasks
 *          to execute after a set interval, facilitating timed operations in an event-driven manner. This mechanism is crucial in
 *          MyOS for managing timed events and callbacks efficiently within the constraints of a cooperative environment.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * // Example usage would typically involve etimers or ctimers, as ptimer is an abstract class.

 * @brief Starts a process timer with a specified duration and handler.

 *          This is a key function for scheduling time-based actions within the MyOS, allowing for precise control

 *          ensuring it is actively tracked and managed. This function is useful for reusing timers or resetting their
 *          timing without changing the duration or handler function.
 * @param[in] ptimer Pointer to the process timer to restart.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 *     ptimer_t my_ptimer;
 *     // Initialize and start my_ptimer
 *     ptimer_restart(&my_ptimer); // Restart my_ptimer, resetting its countdown

 * @brief Resets a process timer.
 * @details This function is crucial for the management of process timers in MyOS. It resets the timer associated

 *          particularly useful for periodic tasks where the timer needs to be reused regularly. After resetting the
 *          timer, the ptimer is added back to the ptimer_running_list to ensure it remains active and is processed
 *          correctly.
 * @param[in] ptimer Pointer to the process timer to reset.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 *     ptimer_t my_ptimer;

 * @def ptimer_stop(ptimerptr)

 *          any relevant system states and statistics related to the process timer. It's essential for correctly
 *          managing the lifecycle of a process timer, ensuring that timers are deactivated when they are no longer needed.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 *     ptimer_t my_ptimer;
 *     // Initialize and start my_ptimer
 *     ptimer_stop(&my_ptimer); // Stop the ptimer and remove it from the running list

/*!
 * @brief Checks if a process timer has expired.
 * @details This macro is used to determine whether a given process timer (ptimer) has reached its expiration time in MyOS.

 *          in process management, enabling processes to respond to timed events. The macro simplifies the interface for checking timer expiration.
 * @param[in] ptimerptr Pointer to the process timer being checked.
 *
