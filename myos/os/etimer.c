/*!
 * @brief Handler for event timer expiration.
 * @details This function serves as the timeout handler for event timers (etimers) in MyOS. It's invoked when an etimer expires.
 *          The function casts the provided ptimer to its derived etimer type and then checks if the destination process for
 *          the event is running. If so, it delivers the scheduled event to the target process using process_deliver_event.
 *          This mechanism is key to the event-driven architecture of MyOS, allowing timers to trigger specific actions in processes.
 * @param[in] ptimer Pointer to the process timer associated with the etimer.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 *     // This handler is used internally by etimers and not typically called directly by user code.
 * @endcode
