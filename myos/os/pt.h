 * @brief Protothread definitions for MyOs.
 *
 * @details
 * Protothreads are a lightweight, stackless threading mechanism, offering
 * a way to implement non-blocking code in a blocking manner, which is
 * particularly useful in resource-constrained systems like embedded devices.
 * This implementation is based on Contiki 2.7 protothread but has been adapted
 * and extended for use in myos.
 *
 * Protothreads provide a way to perform tasks in threads without using multiple
 * stacks. This is achieved through the use of local continuations that save
 * and restore the execution state of a function at specific points.
 * Local continuations in this implementation are based on Duff's device, a
 * technique for creating a coroutine in C.
 *
 * Adaptations from the original Contiki implementation:
 * - Removal of the local auto variable PT_YIELD_FLAG required for suspending the task.
 * - Addition of the LC_SET_YIELD macro to properly suspend and resume protothreads.
 * - Modifications to enhance portability and efficiency in different environments.
 *
 * Protothreads are particularly effective in event-driven systems where tasks do
 * not need to be executed simultaneously but rather wait for specific events or
 * conditions to proceed. They offer a simple and memory-efficient mechanism
 * for implementing cooperative multitasking.
 *
 * @note Protothreads do not save the call stack, thus local variables are not
 * preserved across blocking calls. Care must be taken to preserve the state
 * across yields or waits if needed.
