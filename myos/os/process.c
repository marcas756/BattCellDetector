/**
 * @brief Delivers an event to a process.
 *
 * @param evt Pointer to the process event to be delivered.
 * @return True if the event was successfully delivered, False otherwise.
 *
 * @details
 * This function is responsible for delivering an event to a specific process.
 * It first checks if the target process is running or if the event is a start
 * event. If so, it switches the context to the target process and then invokes
 * the process's thread function, passing the event to it.
 *
 * During the event handling, this function measures the execution time of the
 * process (slicetime) and updates the process's `maxslicetime` if the current
 * execution time is the longest one recorded. This feature is only active if
 * `MYOSCONF_STATS` is defined.
 *
 * If the process's state after handling the event is `PT_STATE_TERMINATED`, the
 * process is removed from the running processes list. The function then restores
 * the original process context.
 *
 * @note
 * This function is typically called internally by the process management system
 * and should not be called directly in application code.
 *
 * Debugging messages are printed with information about the event delivery if
 * the DEBUG_PROCESS macro is defined.
 *
 * @code
 * // Example usage within the process management system
 * process_event_t my_event;
 * // Initialize my_event...
 * process_deliver_event(&my_event);
