 * @details This static variable is a list that holds all the currently active process timers (ptimers) in MyOS.
 *          It's a central component in the ptimer system, used for tracking and managing timers that are currently in use.
 *          The list is updated whenever a ptimer is started or stopped, ensuring accurate and efficient timer management.
 *          The type of the list (double-linked or single-linked) depends on the MyOS configuration.

 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 *     // Example of iterating over the ptimer_running_list
 *     ptlist_node_t *node;

 *          This allows the system to efficiently manage and wake up for the next ptimer event without unnecessary checks.
 *          The variable is updated whenever a new ptimer is added or an existing one is modified.

 * @brief      Adds a process timer to the active list in MyOS.
 * @details    This function is crucial for managing process timers in MyOS. It's responsible for adding a new ptimer
 *             to the ptimer_running_list, which is a list of all currently active ptimers. The function first checks
 *             if the ptimer is already running to avoid duplicates. If it's not running, the ptimer is added to the
 *             front of the ptimer_running_list, and its running status is set to true. This is important for subsequent
 *             timer operations that rely on this list to determine active timers.
 *
 *             Additionally, if MyOS is configured to collect statistics (MYOSCONF_STATS), the function updates the
 *             ptimer_list_size and checks if it exceeds the maximum size recorded (myos_stats.ptlist_size_max), updating
 *             the maximum size if necessary. This statistical data can be vital for performance tuning and system monitoring.
 *
 *             Finally, the function calls ptimer_next_stop_update to ensure the system accurately tracks the next
 *             expiration time across all timers, optimizing timer management and processing.
 *
 * @param[in]  ptimer Pointer to the process timer to add to the running list.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 *     ptimer_t my_ptimer;
 *     // Initialize my_ptimer
 *     ptimer_add_to_list(&my_ptimer); // Add the ptimer to the running list and update system state

 * @brief      Removes a process timer from the active list.
 * @details    This function handles the removal of a process timer from the ptimer_running_list in MyOS.
 *             It's a critical part of the ptimer management system, ensuring that timers no longer needed
 *             or expired are not kept in the active list, optimizing system resources.
 *
 *             The function first checks if the ptimer is running. If so, it sets the running status to false,
 *             indicating that the timer is no longer active. It then removes the ptimer from the
 *             ptimer_running_list using the ptlist_erase function. This removal is vital to prevent the system
 *             from processing an inactive timer.
 *
 *             If MyOS is configured with MYOSCONF_STATS, the function decrements the ptimer_list_size counter.
 *             This decrement is crucial for accurate system monitoring and statistics, particularly in systems
 *             where resource usage and performance are critical.
 *
 * @param[in]  ptimer Pointer to the process timer to remove from the running list.
