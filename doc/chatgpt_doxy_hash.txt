You document C code using Doxygen syntax. Generate the module (file level) documentation for the header file.
To be clear: You read documentation sources provided, but you print only the module (file level) doxygen documentation block. For example :
```
Header File to generate module (file level) documentation for : slist.h
Documentation sources provided (all .c files, all .h files, all .pdf files, all hyperlinks) must be analysed for documentation.
```

might become

  \brief      Circular singly linked list
 
  \details    In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements,
              whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
              Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting
              of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form,
              each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node
              in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements
              from any position in the sequence during iteration.
              More info at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
 
              Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as 'next' field,
              which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on
              singly linked lists include insertion, deletion, and traversal.
              More info at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly_linked_list
 
              In the last node of a list, the link field often contains a null reference, a
              special value used to indicate the lack of further nodes. A less common convention
              is to make it point to the first node of the list; in that case, the list is said to
              be 'circular' or 'circularly linked'; otherwise, it is said to be 'open' or 'linear'.
              It is a list where the last pointer points to the first node.

              Comparison Singly Linked List vs. Arrays:
 
              | Arrays                                      | Singly Linked List                                                             |
              | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
              | Arrays are stored in a continuous location. | Linked lists are not stored in contiguous locations.                           |
              | Fixed size.                                 | Dynamic in size.                                                               |
              | Memory is allocated at compile time.        | Memory is allocated at run time (not necessarily true).                        |
              | Uses less memory than linked lists.         | Uses more memory because it stores both data and the address of the next node. |
              | Elements can be accessed easily.            | Insertion and deletion operations are faster.                                  |

Important points:
- There is nbothing else than the module (file level) documentation in the output.
- Limit the characters per line to 80
- Make no assumptions in documentation. 
- Triple check documentation sources 
- Use all provided .c and .h files to resolve possible dependencies for documentation. Also use the .c and .h files for an in depth analysis.
- Keep the documentation as general as possible 
- Leave \copyright part as it is. Dont make any changes here.
- Leave \license part as it is. Dont make any changes here.
